# CleanDataAccessLayer

> **Important:** This project is a greenfield class library. Do **not** modify the legacy helper under `Helper/DataAccessLayer/Common/DbHelper`. All new work must live here so the original implementation stays untouched.

This library hosts the clean Database Helper implementation described in `DataacceslaterCleanNew/CleanDataAccessLayer.LibraryPlan.md`. Use it to evolve the DAL through a simplified façade and improved request builders without affecting the existing production helper.
